# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/SaiAnushaKodali/telecom-churn-analysis-CS6010/blob/main/Telco_Churn_Project_CS6010.ipynb) 
This proejct performs an in-depth analysis on a telecom company's customer dataset to predict customer churn. It aims to determine the main indicators of why customers leave and which customers are likely to churn.

## Machine Learning Workflow

The analysis follows the typical machine learning workflow:

1. Importing libraries and dataset
2. Exploratory data analysis
   - Summary statistics
   - Visualizations
3. Data preprocessing
4. Training machine learning models
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - SVM (with different kernels)
5. Evaluating model performance
   - Classification report
   - ROC Curve
   - Confusion matrix

The key findings and results are documented throughout the notebook with code, visualizations, and commentary.

## Conclusion

This project serves as the final project for the Data Science Programming (DS6010) course. It demonstrates a comprehensive investigation into the factors influencing customer churn and develops well-performing models to predict churn.
